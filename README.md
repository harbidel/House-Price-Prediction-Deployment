I will be using linear regression to predict the sales value in the third month using rate of interest and sales of the first two months.

# What is Linear Regression
The objective of a linear regression model is to find a relationship between one or more features(independent variables) and a continuous target variable(dependent variable). When there is only one feature it is called Uni-variate Linear Regression and if there are multiple features, it is called Multiple Linear Regression.
